# Low level I/O Procedures

This program uses x86 Assembly low level I/O procedures and macros to get 10 valid signed integers from the user and stores the numeric values in an
array. The program then displays the integers, their sum, and their average (rounded down to the nearest integer).

The integers are read as a string, which is then converted to a numerical value so that the sum and average operations can be performed. 

## Usage

Download and open the Project 6.asm file using Microsoft Visual Studio. Then, run the application by selecting Debug -> Start Without Debugging.
